#  No hands to handle my cursor - Mouse cursor control using facial movements

This HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) application in Python(3.6) will allow you to control your mouse cursor with your facial movements, works with just your regular webcam. Its hands-free, no wearable hardware or sensors needed.

At this point, you are forced to work with the facial movements I chose but I am working on making them configurable. The list of actions include:

 - Squinting your eyes (**squint** - To look with the eyes partly closed, as in bright sunlight)
 - Winking
 - Moving your head around (pitch and yaw)
 - Opening your mouth (a little bit, yes)

Special thanks to **Adrian Rosebrock** for his amazing blog posts [[2](#references)] [[3](#references)], code snippets and his imutils library [[7](#references)] that played an important role in making this idea of mine a reality.

## Working Example
<img src="demo.gif">

## Code Requirements
* Numpy - 1.13.3
* OpenCV - 3.2.0
* PyAutoGUI - 0.9.36
* Dlib - 19.4.0
* Imutils - 0.4.6

## Execution
Order of Execution is as follows:

1. Follow these installation guides - [Numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/), [OpenCV](https://medium.com/@akshaychandra21/f5f721f0d0b3), [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html), [Dlib](https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv-3-and-dlib-on-windows-python-only/), [Imutils](https://github.com/jrosebr1/imutils) and install the right versions of the libraries (mentioned above).
2. Make sure you have the model downloaded. Read the README.txt file inside the model folder for the link. 
3. `python mouse-cursor-control.py`

Please raise an issue in case of any errors. 

## Usage
 
I definitely understand that these facial movements could be a little bit weird to do, especially when you are around people. Being a patient of [benign-positional-vertigo](https://www.healthline.com/health/benign-positional-vertigo), I hate doing some of these actions myself. But I hope to make them easier and less weird over time. Feel free to suggest some public friendly actions that I can incorporate in the project.

## How It Works
This project is deeply centered around predicting the facial landmarks of a given face. We can accomplish a lot of things using these landmarks. From detecting eye-blinks [[3](#references)] in a video to predicting emotions of the subject. The applications, outcomes and possibilities of facial landmarks are immense and intriguing.

[Dlib](dlib.net/)'s prebuilt model, which is essentially an implementation of [[4](#references)], not only does a fast face-detection but also allows us to accurately predict 68 2D facial landmarks. Very handy.  

<div align="center">
<img src="images/facial-landmarks-68.jpg" width=500 height=190/>
</div>

Using these predicted landmarks of the face, we can build appropriate features that will further allow us to detect certain actions, like using the eye-aspect-ratio (more on this below) to detect a blink or a wink, using the mouth-aspect-ratio to detect a yawn etc or maybe even a pout. In this project, these actions are programmed as triggers to control the mouse cursor. [PyAutoGUI](http://pyautogui.readthedocs.io) library was used to control the mouse cursor. 

### Eye-Aspect-Ratio (EAR)
You will see that Eye-Aspect-Ratio [[1](#references)] is the simplest and the most elegant feature that takes good advantage of the facial landmarks. EAR helps us in detecting blinks [[3](#references)] and winks etc.  
<div align="center">
<img src="images/EAR-final.png" width=772 height=298/>
</div>

You can see that the EAR value drops whenever the eye closes. We can train a simple classifier to detect the drop. However, a normal if condition works just fine. Something like this:

    if EAR <= SOME_THRESHOLD:
       EYE_STATUS = 'CLOSE'
    
### Mouth-Aspect-Ratio (MAR)
Highly inspired by the EAR feature, I tweaked the formula a little bit to get a metric that can detect open/closed mouth. Unoriginal but it works.  

<div align="center">
<img src="images/MAR-final.jpg" width=700 height=300/>
</div>

Similar to EAR, MAR value goes up when the mouth opens. Similar intuitions hold true for this metric as well. 

## Prebuilt Model Details

The model offers two important functions. A detector to detect the face and a predictor to predict the landmarks. The face detector used is made using the classic Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature combined with a linear classifier, an image pyramid, and sliding window detection scheme. 

The facial landmarks estimator was created by using dlib's implementation of the paper:
[One Millisecond Face Alignment with an Ensemble of Regression Trees by
      Vahid Kazemi and Josephine Sullivan, CVPR 2014](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/One-millisecond-face-alignment-with-an-ensemble-of-Kazemi-Sullivan/1824b1ccace464ba275ccc86619feaa89018c0ad). 
And was trained on the iBUG 300-W face landmark dataset: C. Sagonas, E. Antonakos, G, Tzimiropoulos, S. Zafeiriou, M. Pantic. 300 faces In-the-wild challenge: Database and results.

You can get the trained model file from http://dlib.net/files, click on **shape\_predictor\_68\_face\_landmarks.dat.bz2**. The model dat file has to be in the model folder.

Note: The license for the iBUG 300-W dataset excludes commercial use. So you should contact Imperial College London to find out if it's OK for you to use this model file in a commercial product.
